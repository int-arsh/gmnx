## üõ†Ô∏è Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to get the Gemini CLI Assistant running on your system.

### Prerequisites

-   Python 3.x 
-   A Google Gemini API Key. You can get one from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).

### 1. Clone the Repository

If you have uploaded the project to GitHub, clone it to your local machine.

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/your-username/gemini-cli-tool.git](https://github.com/your-username/gemini-cli-tool.git)
cd gemini-cli-tool
```

If you are just setting it up locally, simply navigate to your project directory.
2. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment

It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies.

### Create the virtual environment
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
```
### Activate it
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### Install Dependencies

Create a requirements.txt file with the necessary Python packages.

    requirements.txt:

    google-genai
    rich

Now, install these packages using pip:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Make the Script Executable

This step gives your system permission to run the ask.py file as a program.
```bash
chmod +x ask.py
```
### Set Your API Key and Alias

To make the tool accessible from anywhere, you need to set an environment variable for your API key and create a command-line alias.

Open your shell's configuration file (e.g., ~/.bashrc, ~/.zshrc):
```bash
nano ~/.bashrc
```
Add the following lines to the end of the file. Remember to replace your_api_key_here with your actual key and update the path to your script.

```bash
# Gemini CLI Assistant
export GEMINI_API_KEY='your_api_key_here'
alias ask='/path/to/your/project/gemini-cli-tool/ask.py'
```

Save the file and reload your shell configuration:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

## Usage

You can now use the ask command directly in your terminal. Just wrap your question in quotes.
Examples

Get a Linux command:
```bash
ask "how to find all files larger than 50MB in my home directory"
```
Explain a concept:
```bash
ask "explain the difference between a soft link and a hard link"
```
Get a code snippet:
```bash
ask "write a python function that takes a list and returns a new list with only the even numbers"
```
